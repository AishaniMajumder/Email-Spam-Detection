# üìß Email Spam Detector

This project is a machine learning-based email spam detection tool that classifies emails as either **spam** or **ham** (non-spam). Using Python and natural language processing (NLP), the model is trained to recognize patterns and keywords commonly associated with spam. This repository contains all code, datasets, and steps required to set up and train the spam detector.

## üìå Project Overview

Email spam detection is crucial to prevent unwanted and potentially harmful content from reaching users. This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails into **spam** or **ham** using a labeled dataset. Techniques include data preprocessing, text vectorization with CountVectorizer, and classification with a Naive Bayes algorithm.

## üîç Features

- Preprocesses and cleans email text data
- Converts text data into numerical features with CountVectorizer
- Uses a Naive Bayes classifier for spam detection
- Provides evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for easier code execution and visualization)

### Install Required Libraries

Use the following command to install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## üìÇ Dataset

Download the spam email dataset [from here](#) (provide dataset link) and place it in your project folder. The dataset should include two columns:
- `v1`: The label (`ham` or `spam`)
- `v2`: The email message content

## üõ† Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
   - **Column Renaming**: Rename columns for clarity.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
   - **Label Encoding**: Convert labels (`ham`, `spam`) into numerical values (0 and 1).

### 2. Feature Extraction with CountVectorizer
   - Use `CountVectorizer` to transform text messages into vectors based on word frequency, creating a "Bag of Words" model.

### 3. Model Training
   - Train a **Naive Bayes classifier** on the transformed dataset, which is well-suited for text classification tasks.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   - Assess the model‚Äôs performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the project code in sequence using Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE. Follow these steps:

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**:
   - Load the dataset and apply preprocessing as shown in the code files.
   
2. **Train the Model**:
   - Execute the training script to fit the model on the dataset.

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using the test set to check its accuracy and reliability in spam classification.

4. **Predict New Emails**:
   - Use the trained model to classify new emails as spam or ham.

### Example

```python
# Load data and train model
python spam_detector.py

# Predict a sample email
python predict.py "Your free offer is waiting! Click now to claim your prize."
```

## üèÜ Results

The model provides the following key metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correctly classified emails.
- **Precision** and **Recall**: Indicate the model's effectiveness in identifying spam messages.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall to evaluate overall performance.

Sample classification report:
```plaintext
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.99      0.99       965
           1       0.94      0.91      0.93       150

    accuracy                           0.98      1115
   macro avg       0.97      0.95      0.96      1115
